title: The Complete Guide to Printing Yellow Letters for Free

The first step is to convert your existing spreadsheet into an actual database -- a step that's not necessary in MS Office and unfortunately one you'll need to repeat every time you update your spreadsheet --say when delete records for returned yellow letters or eliminate sellers you've already spoken to who are not motivated.

Make sure you leave to option to "register the database" checked, this makes your new database available as a data source for other LibreOffice files -- like the word processing doc we'll be merging our data into.

Now open up your letter or create a new document and type in the letter you want to send. You can download the version I use if you want, but I suggest tweaking it to fit your approach (and keep track of which letters do the best so you can refine your text over time for the best results).

The next step is to open up the database we created earlier. To do that we click on the View menu and select "Data Sources" near the bottom of the list. That will open up a new pane at the top of your document where you'll see the "my list database" option we created earlier (along with any other databases you may have created previously). Click the arrow next to "my list database" and you'll see two items -- Queries and Table. Click the arrow next to tables and you'll see the name of your actual sheet, if you're using U.S Leads List data that will probably be "List Report." Click that and you'll see your data in the table to the right.

Now its time to tell our yellow letter file which fields to insert from our database. Put your cursor after "Dear " and then head up to the table of data. Click to select the owner first name column and then grab the table header and drag it into your document, letting go just after "Dear ". Now that line should look like "Dear <OWNER FIRST NAME>". The <OWNER FIRST NAME> bit is just a placeholder, when we actually merge our two documents LibreOffice will insert that field from the data base into our yellow letter.

Two further personalize our yellow letter, we want to include the owner's property address. That way your letter is more personalized to the seller, which helps that person feel more comfortable calling you. So create a sentence something along the lines of "My name is Nathan Scott and I want to buy your property at". After the "at" we'll insert a placeholder so that LibreOffice will fill in the property address. To do that we just repeat the same steps used to the name: click the column header that says property address (beware, there's usually a mailing address column as well, make sure you click on the `property address`). Now drag that column header down into the document and place it after the "at" in the sentence we wrote earlier.

If you're using a simple yellow letter that's all you need to do. If you're doing something more complex, like one of the longer Sean Terry yellow letter templates you may have a couple more places to insert data (Terry's letter uses the address a couple of times).

Now for the best part -- printing you yellow letters for FREE! Head to file, select "Print" and LibreOffice will say "Your document contains address database fields. Do you want to print a form letter?" Hit yes and you'll get the first print dialog. Here you want double check and make sure the right fields from the database are shown and then select "all" or a subset of records if you only want to print a few letters. In the right side of the dialog you'll see an option to either send your merge directly to the printer or save it as a file.

I strongly recommend you save it as a file and then double check just to make sure everything worked as you expected and there are no mistakes. So select the "File" option and save as a single documents (unless for some reason you want a ton of individual files). Hit okay and Libre Office will ask you what you want to name the file and where to save it. Give it a name, save it wherever you like and then go open the new file and take a look.

Assuming everything went well you should have a document with one yellow letter per page, personalized for each seller and property on your lead list. If everything is looking the way you like go ahead and print. I typically do this with bulk yellow paper, but if you're just starting out and you've got some spare legal pads and you're tearing out sheets on your own I recommend printing only about 10 pages at a time to avoid excessive paper curling and printer jamming.

And there you have it, customized yellow letters in your handwriting for only the price of paper and ink (for me that means about $0.02 per letter). Nexxt we'll take a look at the slightly more expensive -- but still far cheaper than going to a printer -- process of printing envelopes.
