What do you do if the house isn't moving?

Welll, talk to your buyers, find out why they aren't buying. Is the price too high? Do they disagree with the ARV? Are the repairs more than you thought? find out why, this is still sales, talk to your customers and find out why they aren't buying your product. Once you know that you can proceed, perhaps by lowering your price, perhaps by renoegoting your price with the seller or what have you.

Googled for contractors in the area. Don't pay, just say, look I need someone to go out and look at the house, give me a rough quick and dirty estimate, you don't need to take pictures or have a written estimate. Say I'd like to be able to work with you on this house, tell them you're hoping to work with them. Every contractor will have a different bid. Some will do it some won't, keep calling until you get someone. Make it as simple as possible for them -- "say you're the only contractor I've talked to, you have good reviews online, I'd like to be able to work with you on this deal."

Alternately you can pay the inspector -- less biased, more powerful when it comes to negotiating -- you can find out what's up to code and what's not and that stuff can help you renegotiate if you need to.
