title: About Nathan Scott and The Ultimate REI Guide
---

My name is Nathan Scott and I sell houses. 

Technically I buy them first, but I think of what I do as selling houses, not buying them. And I don't sell to home buyers, I sell to the big boys -- real estate investors with serious money who pay cash. I find the off market deals, contract with motivated sellers and turn around and sell that contract to my cash buyers. It's the simplest, easiest way I know of to generate money with hardly any effort on your part. 

I know what you're thinking. Hell yes! Easy money! Sign me up. Here's where I have to burst your bubble: Getting from where you are to where I am isn't as easy as it might seem. It takes hard work, but more importantly, it takes smart work. The smarter you work the better you work, which is why I put this site together -- to help you avoid the mistakes I made, work smarter and get your real estate wholesaling business off the ground. I said it wasn't as easy as it sounds... it's not, but by working smarter and harder, you can do it.

When I started out guys like Sean Terry and tk were a huge help. Both of them give away detailed information on how to get started in this business. Sean's podcast especially was invaluable both in terms of content and inspiration. 

But as with anything the real estate market changes quickly, online advertising even quicker and some of those old podcasts, while still great as an overview, aren't up-to-date with the latest software and tools.

I ran into all sorts of problems even before I had done my first deal. The gurus tell you marketing is everything, the more leads the more deals. There's a kind of mantra thrown at beginners: Send Yellow Letters, send Yellow Letters, Send Yellow Letters. All that advice is true and Yellow Letters can be a good way to start generating leads. 

So that advice is great, but buying a quality lead list like an inheritance list costs upwards of $500, then you're telling me I've got to spend $1.36 per lead to get out a first class yellow letter? I'm no math whiz, but that's over $1000. Chump change to some, but when I started out I didn't have that kind of money to toss around. I had a wife and two kids, no job and a tiny savings to tide us over until I found another job. I didn't have over a grand to drop on something that might or might not work.

So I figured out a cheaper way to market for motivated sellers. Yes, I still did yellow letters, I just did them myself. And no I didn't write thousands of letters by hand. I worked smarter, printing them myself, printing the envelopes myself. What would have cost around $1200 per 500 yellow letters only cost me $750. Still not free, but it allowed me to send twice as many letters as the next guy.

And that's what The Ultimate REI Guide is here to do, take you through the minutia and help you discover how to work not just harder, but smarter.
